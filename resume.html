		<h3>Scott C Moore</h3>
		<h4>Software Developer</h4>
		<p>
			I enjoy finding elegant technical solutions to real-world problems. I am skilled at determining underlying business needs and how software can address them, and at working with customers and stakeholders at all levels of technical savvy. I am able to quickly learn new technologies, processes, and standards, and I take initiative to fill gaps in my knowledge. I am interested in opportunities to demonstrate and improve my ability to connect pressing business needs with well-crafted software solutions.
