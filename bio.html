<h1>Bio</h1>

<div class="post">
<p>
I am Scott Moore, a software developer. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to beginning this career, I was a bicycle mechanic with a bronze sculpture degree. Wrenching on bikes was work that I loved, but it came with a paycheck I hated. Worse than the pay were the processes -- endless, repetitive paperwork, filled by hand, then <span class="italicized">maybe</span> entered into the point-of-sale system. Or maybe not. If only I could solve problems like inventory <span class="italicized">once</span>, and have them stay solved...
</p><p>
Computer programming was the next step. Of course not every problem stayed solved, and I've fought my fair share of battles against undocumented legacy code, "temporary" hacks, and nebulous specs. But I still love it, and never more than when I've been able to bring a little order out of the chaos, and save some human being from doing a job more fit for a machine.
</p>
<p>
My hope is that this site will be a place for me to showcase a progression of steadily improving code, and share thoughts on life in this inspiring profession. Stay tuned!
