<h2>Bio</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>
Hi! I'm a software developer in the process of relocating from Richmond, VA to Denver, CO. I currently work for Virginia Commonwealth University's <a href="http://www/vcurrtc.org">Rehabilitation Research and Training Center</a> on Employment of People with Physical Disabilities. The RRTC "conduct[s] advanced research, training, technical assistance, and dissemination activities specifically to improve the employment outcomes of individuals with physical disabilities."</p>
<p>I am also available for web application development on a project basis. You can see some of my prior work at <a href="projects.html">my projects page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Outside of writing code, I like to ride bikes, sketch, and cook with my wife Caitlin.
</p>
<p>If you're in the Denver and looking for a full-stack web developer for either full time or project-based work, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@scottcmoore.com">hello@scottcmoore.com</a>. I'd love to hear from you!
